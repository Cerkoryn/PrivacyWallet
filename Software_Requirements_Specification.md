##### 1. Introduction
###### 1.1. Purpose
The open-source privacy wallet on the Cardano blockchain offers users a simple and easy-to-use solution for managing their transactions and personal information in a private and secure manner. Unlike mixer services, which have been stigmatized as tools for criminal activity, a privacy wallet offers a much more positive perspective on privacy. This is because a wallet is a personal and decentralized tool that allows individuals to take control of their own privacy, rather than relying on a third-party service to protect their information. Additionally, the wallet's cross-chain compatibility, compliance with privacy regulations, and resistance to side-channel attacks ensures that users' personal information is protected, even when making transactions on the blockchain. This not only protects users' privacy, but also helps to mitigate the stigma surrounding private transactions on the blockchain.

Furthermore, many jurisdictions, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and the Privacy Act of 1974, require that private information be protected. This makes it necessary for organizations and individuals to implement measures to protect personal information, and a privacy wallet is an effective tool for doing so. The wallet's compliance with these regulations ensures that users' personal information is protected in accordance with the law, and the wallet's resistance to side-channel attacks ensures that this information remains private and secure, even when making transactions on the blockchain.

###### 1.2. Scope
The scope of this project includes the development of an open-source privacy wallet on the Cardano blockchain that is private by default, compliant with relevant privacy regulations, and resistant to side-channel attacks. The wallet will utilize the W3 DID standard for storing user identity information, and will also incorporate Atala Prism and the Midnight sidechain for enhanced privacy and security.

###### 1.3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
